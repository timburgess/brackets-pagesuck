PageSuck - An Extension for Adobe Brackets (EdgeCode)
=====================================================

PageSuck is an extension to Adobe Brackets that allows you to pull the contents
of any URL directly into your editor. See a webpage where you wonder 'how did they do that?'
Have a page on a remote production server that you would like to tweak and experiment with?

With PageSuck installed, simply Alt-S, type in the full URL and PageSuck will suck the
the contents of that page directly into a new editor file for you.

Raymond Camden blogged (and did a demo screencast) about PageSuck on the [Adobe Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/2013/02/11/pagesuck-brackets-extension/#more-402).

Kevin Dangoor did a presentation at [Adobe MAX 2013 about Brackets Extensions](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2013/extending-brackets-with-javascript/) using PageSuck as an example.

To install

PageSuck is available in the Brackets Extension Registry. Click on the Plugin icon on the right hand side.
Then click on the list of available extensions and click *Install* to install PageSuck. (To see where the
code is installed, in Brackets choose Help->Show Extensions Folder.)

Alternatively, if you are using Brackets from the source code, *git clone* a ```PageSuck``` folder
inside the ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder, and reload Brackets.

**Compatible with Brackets Sprint 28 or later**
